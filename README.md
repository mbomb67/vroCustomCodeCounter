# vRealize Orchestrator Custom Code Counter
Count lines of code/characters written in vRO. 

## Compatibility
The current iteration of the tool was developed and tested against vRealize Orchestrator versions 7.6, 7.5, and 7.4. It is possible that it may be compatible with some older versions as well. If using an older version, you may not be able to use the feature that gathers the presentation information depending on whether or not the vRO REST API included the call I am using to gather the workflow content. At some point, I hope to test it with vRO 8.1+ as well.
